# FizzBuzz

Program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered.
However, for multiples of three program prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five it prints Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints FizzBuzz.
